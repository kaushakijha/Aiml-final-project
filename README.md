The "Hand Movement Tracking"
project utilizes the power of computer
vision and machine learning to track
and visualize hand movements in realtime. Leveraging the capabilities of
OpenCV, Mediapipe, utils and
Numpy, this project aims to detect and
monitor the movement of hand
landmarks using a webcam feed.
